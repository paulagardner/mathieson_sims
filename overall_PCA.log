Error: This run requires decent allele frequencies, but they aren't being
loaded with --read-freq, and less than 50 samples are available to impute them
from.
You should generate (with --freq) or obtain an allele frequency file based on a
larger similar-population reference dataset, and load it with --read-freq.
